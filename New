Feature Factory — Purpose
	•	Centralized capability to define, compute, govern, and expose AML features across the platform.
	•	Features include:
	•	Raw attributes from transactional and KYC data
	•	Aggregations and calculations (e.g., behavioral metrics, thresholds)
	•	Risk factors and indicators
	•	Rule-based derivations / red flags
	•	Serves multiple consumers:
	•	Model Factory (ML-based and rule-based detections)
	•	Detection workflows
	•	Investigation UI (feature display, red flags, risk context)

⸻

Recommended Positioning: Independent Capability
	•	Feature Factory should be a standalone, shared service, not embedded in any single vertical.
	•	Reasons:
	•	Used by both detection and investigation
	•	Needs independent lifecycle, ownership, and governance
	•	Avoids duplication of feature logic across teams
	•	Enables consistent feature definitions, explainability, and auditability
	•	Acts as a common abstraction layer between:
	•	Data layer (inputs)
	•	Detection / Model Factory / Investigation (consumers)

⸻

Why NOT in the Data Layer
	•	Data layer responsibility:
	•	Ingestion, storage, normalization, basic transformations
	•	Feature Factory responsibility:
	•	Business and risk logic, aggregations, rule-based derivations
	•	Putting Feature Factory in data layer would:
	•	Mix domain logic with data engineering
	•	Reduce flexibility to evolve features independently
	•	Increase maintenance and governance complexity
	•	Risk logic should not be embedded where raw data pipelines are managed.

⸻

Why NOT under Investigation
	•	Investigation is a consumer, not a producer, of features.
	•	Investigation focus:
	•	Alert review, UI, case management, analyst decisioning
	•	Placing Feature Factory here would:
	•	Create upstream dependency on a downstream process
	•	Limit reuse for detection and model execution
	•	Misalign ownership (feature computation vs. UI workflows)

⸻

Summary (Executive View)
	•	Feature Factory = horizontal, reusable capability
	•	Sits between data and consumption layers
	•	Ensures:
	•	Single source of truth for features
	•	Consistent usage across detection and investigation
	•	Better governance, scalability, and regulatory explainability
