1. Problem Context & Need for Standardization
	•	Multiple AML rules and ML models exist today
	•	Inconsistent execution, data access, and output formats
	•	Scattered deployments across servers and databases
	•	Limited governance, scalability, and operational visibility

⸻

2. Model Factory as a Unified Execution Platform
	•	A single umbrella platform for all AML detections
	•	Supports both:
	•	Rule-based detections
	•	ML / AI-based models
	•	Standardizes how detections are run, managed, and consumed

⸻

3. Core Design Principle: Decoupling Data & Execution
	•	Model / rule logic is completely separated from data access
	•	Same model or rule can run on different datasets
	•	Enables reuse, flexibility, and faster onboarding of new detections

⸻

4. Job as the Fundamental Execution Unit
	•	A Job combines:
	•	A rule or a model
	•	A dataset definition
	•	A mapping template
	•	Runtime parameters (including prod vs simulation)
	•	Jobs can be triggered:
	•	Ad hoc
	•	In batch
	•	Via UI or schedulers

⸻

5. Dataset Definition as a First-Class Entity
	•	Defines how and from where data is fetched
	•	Supports:
	•	Feature Factory calls
	•	Direct database or API access
	•	Includes:
	•	Connection details
	•	Queries / payloads
	•	List of exposed output columns

⸻

6. Mapping Layer Between Data & Logic
	•	Models and rules use logical column names
	•	Datasets expose physical column names
	•	Mapping templates bind the two at execution time
	•	Mapping is configurable via UI or job definition

⸻

7. Scalable Execution on Kubernetes
	•	Dockerized execution running on Kubernetes
	•	Two scalable pod types:
	•	Rule execution pods (XML / Python rules)
	•	Model execution pods (ML models)
	•	Supports both vertical and horizontal scaling

⸻

8. Standardized Output & Storage Flexibility
	•	All executions produce JSON output
	•	Rule-based detections follow a common output schema
	•	Outputs can be stored in:
	•	Databases
	•	Parquet files
	•	Object storage (e.g., S3)

⸻

9. Model, Rule & Lifecycle Governance
	•	Model Factory owns:
	•	Registry
	•	Versioning
	•	Lineage
	•	Lifecycle management
	•	MLflow used for:
	•	Model registry
	•	Artifact storage
	•	Version tracking
	•	Metadata stored in DB for discoverability and audit

⸻

10. UI, Control & Observability (Parallel Capability)
	•	UI provides:
	•	Model & rule listing
	•	Job definition and execution
	•	Dataset and mapping configuration
	•	Entitlement-based access control
	•	Monitoring, logs, audit trails, and job observability

⸻

One-Line Executive Summary

The Model Factory is a scalable, governed AML detection platform that standardizes execution, decouples data from logic, and provides end-to-end lifecycle management for both rules and ML models.
