High-Level Objectives
Establish a standardized way to define, compute, and consume AML features
Separate raw transactional data from derived analytical intelligence
Reduce heavy computation workloads through reusable intermediate feature layers
Maintain strong regulatory audit readiness with traceable and explainable feature lineage
Enable historical behavioral analysis to power predictive and advanced risk scoring
Feature Categories (Feature Contracts / Policies)
1️⃣ Atomic Features
Definition & Role
Atomic Features form the base truth layer of the Feature Factory. These features capture raw transactional attributes exactly as they occur in source systems without transformation. Each piece of transactional data is stored at the level of an individual transaction and acts as a permanent historical record.
Embedded Characteristics
Represent immutable transactional data (changed only in rare defect remediation cases)
Stored in structured JSON key–value form for flexibility
Serve as the foundational dataset from which all other features are derived
Provide full transparency, audit traceability, and regulatory confidence
Retention governed strictly by compliance policy
Example Sub-Features Transaction amount, timestamp, transaction channel, location, currency, originating entity details, counterparty metadata.
2️⃣ State Features
Definition & Role
State Features are derived, aggregated, and periodically updated features that summarize transactional behavior over defined time intervals and entity scopes. Their core purpose is computational efficiency—they reduce dependence on constantly scanning massive transaction volumes.
Embedded Characteristics
Represent rolled-up or progressive behavioral summaries (daily, weekly, monthly, rolling windows)
Computed primarily at account or customer/entity level
Continuously updated as new atomic transactions arrive
Act as a “computational cache” enabling faster model execution
Maintain linkage to atomic data to ensure explainability and audit traceability
Example Sub-Features Daily transaction count per account, cumulative monthly transaction value, rolling velocity indicators, average transaction amounts, frequency distributions.
3️⃣ Model Features
Definition & Role
Model Features are model-specific, dynamically generated feature sets computed on demand. They are constructed based on predefined model templates that specify exactly which indicators are required for a particular AML detection model.
Embedded Characteristics
Generated through an API request by a detection engine
Primarily derived from State Features (and Atomic Features when required)
Temporarily stored in S3 to support execution evidence and audit reproducibility
Not intended for permanent database storage to avoid unnecessary data persistence
Ensure that every model receives consistent, validated, and complete feature inputs
Usage Machine learning risk models, rule engines, scenario execution, and case evidence generation.
4️⃣ Pair Features (Focus + Counterparty Features)
Definition & Role
Pair Features capture relationship-based behavioral intelligence between a focal party (such as a customer, account, or entity) and its counterparties. Instead of viewing transactions individually, this feature set analyzes interaction patterns over time.
Embedded Characteristics
Represent longitudinal behavioral relationships and transaction dynamics
Retained as long-term records due to their investigative and analytical value
Used extensively for behavioral anomaly detection and contextual understanding
Governed by multi-year retention policies to meet compliance and investigation needs
Support UI visualization, enabling analysts to understand counterparty risk context
Example Sub-Features Frequency of transactions between two entities, aggregate transferred volume between a pair, directional trends, dominant behavior patterns.
5️⃣ Alert Features
Definition & Role
Alert Features store structured intelligence about alerts generated by AML detection mechanisms. They provide historical context for compliance, investigation, and predictive analytics.
Embedded Characteristics
Capture alert trigger details, underlying feature context, model or rule outcomes
Stored for multi-year durations due to regulatory and operational necessity
Enable case management systems to present full contextual histories
Serve as key inputs into predictive scoring models and repeat-offense analysis
Provide complete alert lineage supporting audit reviews and regulator scrutiny
